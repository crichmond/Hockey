Scraping and analysis of data from NHL and other leagues

You need a version of Python3 installed and the core files in each folder to scrape and analyze. 
Use IPython/Jupyter for best experience. Make sure you have NumPy and matplotlib as well. 
Easiest way to get this all (especially on Windows) is with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) --make sure to get a Python3 version).
